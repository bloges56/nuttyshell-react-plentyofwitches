This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Nutshell: The Information Dashboard

## Instructions

Nutshell is a new product offering that you have been tasked with building. It's a dashboard for people to use to organize their daily tasks, events, news article, friends, and chat messages.

You will be utilizing all of the skills and concepts that you've learned up to this point in the course.

1. Functions
1. Databases
1. Github
1. Objects
1. CSS/Flexbox
1. Array methods
1. Components
1. Handling user events
1. Implementing CRUD operations
1. Relational data
1. ERDs

To start you off, here's an example of what the resources in your API should look like once it's populated with some data from your application.

### Users

```json
{ "id": 1, "username": "Steve", "email": "me@me.com" }
```

### Messages

```json
{ "id": 1, "userId": 1, "message": "What's up?" }
```

### News

```json
{
	"id": 1,
	"userId": 2,
	"url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/newfound-wormhole-allows-information-to-escape-black-holes-20171023/",
	"title": "Wormholes Allow Information to Escape Black Holes",
	"synopsis": "Check out this recent discovery about workholes"
}
```

### Friends

```json
{ "id": 1, "userId": 1, "following": 3 }
```

### Tasks

```json
{ "id": 1, "userId": 3, "task": "Take out garbage", "complete": false }
```

## Professional Requirements

1. Each module should have a comment at the top with the following info: author(s) and purpose of module
1. The README for your project should include instructions on how another person can download and run the application

## A Note About Authentication

We want you to know that the login and registration code we have given you is fake, completely insecure, and would never be implemented in a professional application. It is a simulation authentication using very simplistic tools, because authentication is not a learning objective of students at NSS.

You will be using [session storage](https://javascript.info/localstorage#sessionstorage) to keep track of which user has logged into Nutshell. You need to read the code in the **`LoginForm`** and **`RegisterForm`** components so that you see what is going on, but you do not need to change it. However, you will have to use a custom message that is being dispatched by those components.
